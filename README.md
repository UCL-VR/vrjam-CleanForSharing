Instructions (Clean Version for Sharing) 7th November 2022


This project should be loaded in Unity 2019.4.16f1. It builds and runs directly on Meta Quest 1 or 2. 


1)

Our 3D scene is based on a heavily optimised version of 

French Pub Interior by Enozone
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/french-pub-interior-13199

Please show that you have a licence for this asset and we can share our compressed version of the scene. This only affects the scene “3_BarScene”.


2)

You will need a copy of FinalIK from RootMotion

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/final-ik-14290

We are working to get rid of this dependency. 


3)

The song used is a short version of Bosco & Peck's song No Guarantee

https://boscoandpeck.bandcamp.com/track/no-guarantee

The song was performed by two team members: it is not an edited version of the original. We licensed the rights to the song from https://www.beatpick.com/. Licences are still available as of 7/11/2022. If you show that you have a licence for the song, we will send you the files for the performance we made. The animation of the singer is timed to the performance done in our team, not the original song.

Note that this affects two files:

Master Mix - Induction.mp3
Master Mix - No Induction.mp3

The ones included are silent (except for the induction instruction in the first) to keep the animation timings correct.
